# Analysis of Texas Increasing Transmission Capacity with Neighboring Grids to Mitigate Future Blackouts

Introduction to 2021 Texas Power Crisis/Deep Freeze

Potential solutions
* weatherizing
* battery storage
* DC Interconnections

US has three grids, west, east, and texas interconnections

(Include picture of interconnections)

Grids are out of phase, and cannot be directly connected using traditional AC transmission cables

In order for electricity to be tranferred between seperate grids, they must travel through HVDC cables. 

Currently, ERCOT has HVDC connections with SWPP and CENACE

(include map showing Texas DC ties and their capacities)

discuss scraped projects and their capacities

(include graph comparing capacities of current DC, scraped DC ties, and generating capacity of ERCOT)

SWPP - Southwest Power Pool

CENACE - National Center for Energy Control of Mexico

In depth discussion of 2021 Texas Power Crisis
* generators begin to fall off line due to weather. No fuel, cannot operate in cold temperatures, causing grid frequency begins to drop.
* DC connections were for most of the crisis running near or at full capacity. Mexico cut off their electricity supply to Texas when it need it the most.

Introduction to scrapped projects and their capacities.
These DC connections would not have prevented the blackout, but would have reduced their impact and shortened the duration.
* include stat discussing the amount of reduction in electricity at the peak blackout time.
* include stat discussing the reduction in time of the blackouts.
