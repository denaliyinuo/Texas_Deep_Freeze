# Analysis of Texas Increasing Transmission Capacity with Neighboring Grids to Mitigate Future Blackouts

From Feburary 10th to the 20th in 2021, Texas experienced record low temperatures due to three different winter storms, causing blackouts affecting nearly 5 million Texas homes and businesses. The power crisis also resulted in fuel, water, and food shortages. The electricity shortfall in Texas was mainly due to power generator failures, primarily caused by a lack of fuel for operation, as well as frozen pipes and equipment, coniciding with a surge in electricity demand for space heating.

The most popular potential solutions to mitigate or avoid future energy crisis due to extreme weather events concentrate around weatherizing power facilities. This type of solution is not uncommon in the US due to federal regulations, but is not the norm in Texas. Whereas this solution is by far the most necessary and obvious solution to the problem, one rarely discussed solution is to construct HVDC (high voltage direct current) transmission lines, also known as DC ties, with neighboring electricity grids to mitigate future blackouts.

Texas is unique in the United States in that most of the state is served by a state owned and operated grid, separate from the rest of the continental US. The US three grids, known as interconnections, and are called the West Interconnection, the East Interconnection, and the Texas Interconnection.

Grids are out of phase, and cannot be directly connected using traditional AC transmission cables

In order for electricity to be tranferred between seperate grids, they must travel through HVDC cables. 

Currently, ERCOT has HVDC connections with SWPP and CENACE

In depth discussion of 2021 Texas Power Crisis
* generators begin to fall off line due to weather. No fuel, cannot operate in cold temperatures, causing grid frequency begins to drop.
* DC connections were for most of the crisis running near or at full capacity. Mexico cut off their electricity supply to Texas when it need it the most.

Introduction to scrapped projects and their capacities.
These DC connections would not have prevented the blackout, but would have reduced their impact and shortened the duration.
* include stat discussing the amount of reduction in electricity at the peak blackout time. (max shortfall of 28884 MW, could have reduced shortfall by 13.8% during this hour)
* include stat discussing the reduction in time of the blackouts.


Between 3 am on Feb 15th to 6 am on Feb 19th, a 97 hour period, there was an shortfall of approximately 1,670 GWh. Without considering the contributions from the influx of electricity from SWPP and CENACE, ERCOT could only satisfy about 74% of the electricity demand. The inflow from DC ties satisfied about 4% of demand. If the two HVDC projects had not been scrapped, they would have reduced the shortfall by about 24%, resulting in about 84%
