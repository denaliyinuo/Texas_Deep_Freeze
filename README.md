# Analysis of Texas Increasing Transmission Capacity with Neighboring Grids to Mitigate Future Blackouts

From Feburary 10th to the 20th in 2021, Texas experienced record low temperatures due to three different winter storms, causing blackouts affecting nearly 5 million Texas homes and businesses. The power crisis also resulted in fuel, water, and food shortages. The electricity shortfall in Texas was mainly due to power generator failures, primarily caused by a lack of fuel for operation, as well as frozen pipes and equipment, coniciding with a surge in electricity demand for space heating.

The most popular potential solutions to mitigate or avoid future energy crisis due to extreme weather events concentrate around weatherizing power facilities. This type of solution is not uncommon in the US due to federal regulations, but is not the norm in Texas. Whereas this solution is by far the most necessary and obvious solution to the problem, one rarely discussed solution is to construct HVDC (high voltage direct current) transmission lines, also known as DC ties, with neighboring electricity grids to mitigate future blackouts.

Texas is unique in the United States in that most of the state is served by a state owned and operated grid, separate from the rest of the continental US. The US three grids, known as interconnections, and are called the West Interconnection, the East Interconnection, and the Texas Interconnection.

One of the advantages of having a network that serves a large population is that electricity can easily be transmitted to regions that lack electricity, either due to a surge in demand, or a lull in electricity generation, which could be caused by low wind speeds, cloud cover, or generator failure. Typcailly, AC transmission lines are used in these interconnections, which are less expensive than DC cables over geopraphically short distances. The East, West, and Texas Interconnections can share electricity, but must be done by using DC cables, typically HVDC transmission cables. The interconnections cannot be connected direclty with traditional AC cables, since the grids are out of phase, whereas HVDC cables can avoid this problem. the main caveat of using HVDC cables is that they are expensive, and the capacity of the connections between the three US grids is relatively minute in comparision to the total gneerating capacities of these grids. 



Currently, ERCOT has HVDC connections with the East Interconnection and the Mexican grid operated by CENACE (National Center for Energy Control of Mexico). 
SWPP and CENACE. The DC ties with the East Interconnection are connected to the SWPP (Southwest Power Pool) which operates a region generally consiting of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and large swaths of the Dakotas. The DC tie capacities are outlined below.

DC Tie Capacities with ERCOT
* SWPP - 820 MW
* CENACE - 436 MW

In depth discussion of 2021 Texas Power Crisis
* generators begin to fall off line due to weather. No fuel, cannot operate in cold temperatures, causing grid frequency begins to drop.
* DC connections were for most of the crisis running near or at full capacity. Mexico cut off their electricity supply to Texas when it need it the most.

Introduction to scrapped projects and their capacities.
These DC connections would not have prevented the blackout, but would have reduced their impact and shortened the duration.
* include stat discussing the amount of reduction in electricity at the peak blackout time. (max shortfall of 28884 MW, could have reduced shortfall by 13.8% during this hour)
* include stat discussing the reduction in time of the blackouts.


Between 3 am on Feb 15th to 6 am on Feb 19th, a 97 hour period, there was an shortfall of approximately 1,670 GWh. Without considering the contributions from the influx of electricity from SWPP and CENACE, ERCOT could only satisfy about 74% of the electricity demand. The inflow from DC ties satisfied about 4% of demand. If the two HVDC projects had not been scrapped, they would have reduced the shortfall by about 24%, resulting in about 84%
