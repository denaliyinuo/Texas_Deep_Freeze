# Analysis of Texas Increasing Transmission Capacity with Neighboring Grids to Mitigate Future Blackouts

From Feburary 10th to the 20th in 2021, Texas experienced record low temperatures due to three different winter storms, causing blackouts affecting nearly 5 million Texas homes and businesses. The power crisis also resulted in fuel, water, and food shortages. The electricity shortfall in Texas was mainly due to power generator failures, primarily caused by a lack of fuel for operation, as well as frozen pipes and equipment, coniciding with a surge in electricity demand for space heating.

The most popular potential solutions to mitigate or avoid future energy crisis due to extreme weather events concentrate around weatherizing power facilities. This type of solution is not uncommon in the US due to federal regulations, but is not the norm in Texas. Whereas this solution is by far the most necessary and obvious solution to the problem, one rarely discussed solution is to construct HVDC (high voltage direct current) transmission lines, also known as DC ties, with neighboring electricity grids to mitigate future blackouts.

Texas is unique in the United States in that most of the state is served by a state owned and operated grid, separate from the rest of the continental US. The US three grids, known as interconnections, and are called the West Interconnection, the East Interconnection, and the Texas Interconnection.

One of the advantages of having a network that serves a large population is that electricity can easily be transmitted to regions that lack electricity, either due to a surge in demand, or a lull in electricity generation, which could be caused by low wind speeds, cloud cover, or generator failure. Typcailly, AC transmission lines are used in these interconnections, which are less expensive than DC cables over geopraphically short distances. The East, West, and Texas Interconnections can share electricity, but must be done by using DC cables, typically HVDC transmission cables. The interconnections cannot be connected direclty with traditional AC cables, since the grids are out of phase, whereas HVDC cables can avoid this problem. the main caveat of using HVDC cables is that they are expensive, and the capacity of the connections between the three US grids is relatively minute in comparision to the total gneerating capacities of these grids. 

Currently, ERCOT has HVDC connections with the East Interconnection and the Mexican grid operated by CENACE (National Center for Energy Control of Mexico). 
SWPP and CENACE. The DC ties with the East Interconnection are connected to the SWPP (Southwest Power Pool) which operates a region generally consiting of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and large swaths of the Dakotas. The DC tie capacities are outlined below.

Existing HVDC Capacities with ERCOT
* SWPP - 820 MW
* CENACE - 436 MW
* Total - 1256 MW

Previously proposed HVDC projects include the Tres Amigas and Southern Cross projects. The Tres Amigas would be located in eastern New Mexico, and connect the Western and Texas Interconnections. The original proposal that was scrapped called for 2000 MW capacity HVDC lines. A current proposal would connect all three interconnections together. The Texas side of this project would be rated at a capacity of 1500 MW. THe Southern Cross project is a proposed 2000 MW HVDC project that would connect ERCOT to SRCC, which serves much of the southeastern United States. For this analysis, a total of 4000 MW will be used as the capacity of proposed HVDC lines to analyze their impact to reduce and shorten the blackouts during the 2021 Texas power crisis. The proposed projects are more than three times the capacity of the exisiting HVDC lines.

Proposed HVDC Capacities with ERCOT
* Tres Amigas - 2000 MW
* Southern Cross - 2000 MW
* Total - 4000 MW

It is important to understand that the capacities of the existing and proposed HVDC connections pale in comparison to the total installed capacities of all the generators in ERCOT. If the proposed HVDC projects had existed during the 2021 power crisis, they would not have entirely prevented the blackouts, but could have mitigated and shortened the duration of the electricity shortfall. The figure below shows the power flow through the HVDC lines connected to ERCOT before, during, and after the crisis. Both SWPP and CENACE increased power flow to ERCOT to or near max capacity during the early stages of the storms, but once generators started to fall offline in the early hours of Feburary 15th, CENACE stopped providing electricity during the most critical time. Electricity flow between ERCOT and SWPP did not return to normal until the temperatures had returned to a more historical normal around February 20th.

Introduction to scrapped projects and their capacities.
These DC connections would not have prevented the blackout, but would have reduced their impact and shortened the duration.
* include stat discussing the amount of reduction in electricity at the peak blackout time. (max shortfall of 28884 MW, could have reduced shortfall by 13.8% during this hour)
* include stat discussing the reduction in time of the blackouts.

The most severe blackouts occured between 3 am on February 15th to 6 am on February 19th, a period 97 hours. During this time, there was a shortfall of 1,670 GWh, or an average power flow of approximately 17200 MW, and a max power shortfall of nearly 29000 MW. Based on data from the EIA, the day ahead demand curve was used to estimate the actual demand during this time, and in turn, the estimated electricity shortfall. Excluding the electricity provided by SWPP and CENACE, ERCOT was only able to provide about 74% of the electricity demand during this time. The DC ties with SWPP and CENACE provided additional power to satisfy a little over 1% of the demand, increasing the amount of electricity demand satisfied from 74% to 75%. If the proposed 4000 MW HVDC lines had exisited and were able to run at 100% capacity during this time, then they would satisfied about 6% of demand, increasing the satisfied demand from 75% to 81%. This shows that the proposed HVDC projects would have had a significant impact on reducing the blackouts during this crisis.
